# library_project
My first full project in Javascript

## Project Explaination

This is a database that holds information that keeps track of every book and transaction in a library. I had to use javascript functions in order to access data the user needs when using the interface. It can track which books have been borrowed, how long they've been borrowed for, who was the last person to check a particular book out, the name of the author of the book, the most popular books, all books by a given author, and mach more different ways to search for a book of your liking.
